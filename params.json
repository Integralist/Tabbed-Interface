It uses classes to decide which tab container to be visible.\r\n\r\nAt the moment it just does a basic switch between tabs, but if I get time I'll add some fading transitions.\r\n\r\nTODO\r\n-----------------\r\n\r\n* Make the JavaScript more flexible (for example, the hiding of tabs and the number of tabs used should be dynamic)\r\n* Also strip out the reliance on so many id attributes (should really just be a single class applied to a container element)\r\n* Add transitions","google":""}
