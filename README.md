[Integralist](http://www.integralist.co.uk/) - Tabbed Interface
================================

Description
-----------

This is a very basic tabbed interface. It uses classes to decide which tab container to be visible.

At the moment it just does a basic switch between tabs, but I'm considering implementing fade transitions at some point in the future if I get time.

TODO
-----------------

* Make the Js more flexible (for example, the hiding of tabs and the number of tabs used should be dynamic)
* Also strip out the reliance on so many id attributes (should really just be a single class applied to a container element)
* Transitions?
